# xLocalization [inactive]

The xLocalization project aims to provide a simple to use, low cost indoor positioning system for hobbyist use.

# Current State
The PCB works fine. Initial testing with the official decawave firmware showed that the localization works, but is not even close to precise enough for my intended application.
Therefore, this project currently will no longer be worked on. There is currently no code for the ESP8266 available.
